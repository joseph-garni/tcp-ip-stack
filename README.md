Basic TCP-IP Stack in Python

Exploring functionality of TCP-IP Stack with Client and Server files in Python

A full TCP-IP Stack has the following layers:
1. Application Layer
2. Transport Layer
3. Network Layer
4. Data Link
5. Physical Link

In this project I aim to develop deeper functionality including:
1. Implementing full architecture of TCP-IP Stack:
2. IP packets and TCP packets

To run project locally:

1. Git clone repo
2. In main.py set Server PORT NUMBER
3. Run python3 main.py (server file, setup to localhost to listen for client)
4. Run python3 client.py (client file, connecting to server over localhost:PORTNUMBER and sending message to server)
